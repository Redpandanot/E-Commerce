E-Commerce Project
Project Title
E-Commerce Web Application – A sample online shopping platform.
Description
This project is an E-Commerce (electronic commerce) application designed to simulate an online store. In E-Commerce, users can buy and sell products or services via the Internet
en.wikipedia.org
. This application implements common e-commerce features—product catalog, user accounts, shopping cart, and order processing—to demonstrate how a modern online store can be built.
Features
User Registration & Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication uses secure methods (e.g., JWT) to protect user data.
Product Catalog: A list of products with images, descriptions, prices, and stock availability.
Shopping Cart & Orders: Logged-in users can add products to a cart, place orders, and view order history.
Admin Interface: Administrators can add, update, or remove products and manage orders.
RESTful API: Backend follows REST principles, exposing endpoints for products, users, and orders. (A REST API follows the REST architecture for client-server communication.)
Tech Stack
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side application. Node.js is free and open-source, allowing developers to build fast network applications in JavaScript
nodejs.org
.
Express: A minimal, unopinionated web framework for Node.js. It provides routing and middleware to handle HTTP requests easily
github.com
.
MongoDB: A NoSQL document database used to store product, user, and order data. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that is designed for ease of development and scaling
mongodb.com
.
React (optional): For projects that include a front-end, React can be used to build a dynamic, component-based user interface. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
github.com
.
Other Tools: Modern JavaScript (ES6+), npm (package management), and possibly tools like Mongoose (ODM for MongoDB).
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites: Install Node.js (v14+ recommended) and npm. Ensure MongoDB is installed or use a cloud database.
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Redpandanot/E-Commerce.git
cd E-Commerce
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Configure Environment: Create a .env file (if needed) with database URIs and secret keys.
Run the Application:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The server should now be running (e.g., on http://localhost:3000). Use API clients or a web browser to access the endpoints or front-end.

No Future Improvements planned but you could consider these
Enhanced Security: Add features like email verification, password recovery, and rate limiting.
Payment Integration: Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for real transactions.
Search & Filtering: Improve product search, add filters (by category, price, etc.), and pagination for scalability.
Caching: Use Redis or similar caching to speed up frequently accessed data (like popular products).
Testing: Implement automated tests (unit and integration) for backend APIs.
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up continuous integration and deployment for automatic testing and publishing.
